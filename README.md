# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

This repository documents my DSA learning through structured problem solving, implementation, and interview-oriented practice.

The goal is to develop strong algorithmic thinking, recognize reusable patterns, and solve problems independently.

## Current Focus

**Stacks, Queues, Pattern Recognition & Retention**

Currently working on:

- Stack fundamentals and LIFO behaviour

- Resolving previous elements using current elements
- Circular-array traversal
- Array and hashing patterns
- Two pointers and sliding window
- Prefix sums and frequency maps
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Independent implementation
- Mixed-problem solving
- Testing and debugging
- Time and auxiliary-space analysis
- Retention of previously learned patterns

## Today's Progress — October 22, 2026

### LeetCode #496 — Next Greater Element I

- Reconstructed the monotonic-stack solution as a retention check in the topic-based practice folder.
- Used right-to-left traversal to find the next greater element for each value in `nums2`.
- Used a stack to discard elements that cannot be the next greater element.
- Stored results in a hash map and constructed the answer in the order of `nums1`.
- Tested the implementation locally.

**Practice file:** `05_Stacks_Queues/04_next_greater_element_i_retention.cpp`

**Pattern:** Monotonic Stack + Hash Map

### LeetCode #503 — Next Greater Element II

- Implemented a monotonic-stack solution for a circular array.
- Traversed the array twice using modulo indexing to simulate circular traversal.
- Removed elements from the stack that were smaller than or equal to the current element.
- Stored answers only during the first pass and used `-1` when no greater element exists.
- Submitted the solution successfully.

**Implementation:** `LeetCode/0503_next_greater_element_ii.cpp`

**Pattern:** Monotonic Stack + Circular Array

**Complexity:**
- Time: `O(N)`
- Auxiliary space: `O(N)`

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. Understand the problem and its constraints.
2. Identify relevant concepts and patterns.
3. Develop a brute-force baseline.
4. Look for optimization opportunities.
5. Attempt the problem independently.
6. Implement the solution.
7. Test, debug, and examine edge cases.
8. Analyze time and auxiliary-space complexity.
9. Review the reasoning behind the solution.
10. Revisit older patterns through practice.
11. Improve independent problem-solving ability.
12. Commit meaningful work using Git.

The focus is on understanding, implementation, debugging, pattern recognition, and retention rather than maximizing problem count.

## Goal

Build strong algorithmic thinking and independent problem-solving ability for software engineering interviews.

The objective is to understand why solutions work, recognize reusable patterns, implement them independently, debug mistakes, analyze complexity, and apply learned patterns to unfamiliar problems.
