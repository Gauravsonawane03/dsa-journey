# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

This repository documents my DSA learning through structured problem solving, implementation, and interview-oriented practice.

The goal is to develop strong algorithmic thinking, recognize reusable patterns, and solve problems independently.

## Current Focus

**Stacks, Queues, Pattern Recognition & Retention**

Currently working on:

- Stack fundamentals and LIFO behaviour

- Stack and queue operations in C++
- Monotonic-stack reasoning
- Resolving previous elements using current elements
- Array and hashing patterns
- Two pointers and sliding window
- Prefix sums and frequency maps
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Independent implementation
- Mixed-problem solving
- Testing and debugging
- Time and auxiliary-space analysis
- Retention of previously learned patterns

## Today's Progress — October 21, 2026

### LeetCode #155 — Min Stack

- Implemented a stack supporting `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`, and `getMin()`.
- Stored each value alongside the minimum seen at that stack depth.
- Preserved correct minimum tracking when elements are removed, including duplicate minimum values.
- Debugged implementation issues and verified the solution through LeetCode.

**Implementation:** `LeetCode/0155_min_stack.cpp`

**Complexity:**
- `push()`: O(1)
- `pop()`: O(1)
- `top()`: O(1)
- `getMin()`: O(1)
- Auxiliary space: O(N)

### LeetCode #496 — Next Greater Element I

- Implemented a monotonic-stack solution using right-to-left traversal.
- Used a stack to discard elements that cannot be the next greater element.
- Stored next-greater-element results in a hash map for efficient query lookup.
- Constructed the answer in the order of `nums1`.
- Submitted the solution successfully.

**Implementation:** `LeetCode/0496_next_greater_element_i.cpp`

**Pattern:** Monotonic Stack + Hash Map

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of `nums2` and `nums1`, respectively.
- Auxiliary space: O(N)

### LeetCode #525 — Contiguous Array

- Previously practised the prefix-sum and hash-map solution.
- No new implementation was completed for this problem during today's session.

**Implementation:** `LeetCode/0525_contiguous_array.cpp`

**Pattern:** Prefix Sum + Hash Map

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. Understand the problem and its constraints.
2. Identify relevant concepts and patterns.
3. Develop a brute-force baseline.
4. Look for optimization opportunities.
5. Attempt the problem independently.
6. Implement the solution.
7. Test, debug, and examine edge cases.
8. Analyze time and auxiliary-space complexity.
9. Review the reasoning behind the solution.
10. Revisit older patterns through practice.
11. Improve independent problem-solving ability.
12. Commit meaningful work using Git.

The focus is on understanding, implementation, debugging, pattern recognition, and retention rather than maximizing problem count.

## Goal

Build strong algorithmic thinking and independent problem-solving ability for software engineering interviews.

The objective is to understand why solutions work, recognize reusable patterns, implement them independently, debug mistakes, analyze complexity, and apply learned patterns to unfamiliar problems.
